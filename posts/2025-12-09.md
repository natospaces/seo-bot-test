When working with Microsoft Fabric, one common mistake that can undermine data reliability is neglecting to validate data at each step of your pipeline. As data engineers, it's easy to get caught up in the complexity of data transformations and overlook the importance of checking for anomalies or inconsistencies. Skipping validation can lead to the propagation of errors, which not only affects the integrity of the data but also fosters mistrust among stakeholders relying on that data for decision-making.

For example, if you assume that data coming from a source is clean without running necessary checks, you may inadvertently introduce incorrect data into your reports. This can lead to misinformed decisions, wasted resources, and ultimately damage your credibility as a data team. Additionally, hiring new members without emphasizing the importance of thorough validation practices can create gaps in your pipeline’s reliability.

To mitigate these risks, incorporate validation steps throughout your data pipeline, from extraction to analysis. Tools in Microsoft Fabric can assist you, but the key is building a culture of data quality and ensuring that every team member understands their role in maintaining it.
