# Ensuring Data Reliability in Microsoft Fabric for Effective Decision-Making

In organizations leveraging Microsoft Fabric for their data analytics needs, a common failure scenario arises when engineers attempt to translate complex technical metrics to non-technical leadership. For example, miscommunications can occur when executives interpret the data from a Fabric dashboard without understanding its underlying assumptions and data integrity processes. This often leads to misinformed decision-making based on unreliable data insights, which, in turn, can impact business strategy and performance.

This reliability issue often stems from a disconnect between technical teams, who understand the nuances of data sources and transformations, and leadership, which relies on concise, actionable insights. Without clear communication, alongside well-defined data governance practices, the risk of basing critical business decisions on faulty assumptions increases significantly.

Moreover, modern AI tools offer both promise and peril regarding data reliability. On one hand, they have the potential to automate and streamline data cleaning processes, greatly enhancing output quality. On the other, reliance on AI without human oversight can lead to decisions based on flawed predictive models or unverified datasets, exacerbating trust issues in data. Therefore, hiring teams should prioritize candidates who can bridge this gap and effectively communicate complex data insights to empower better leadership decisions.
