Data reliability is crucial for any team building and maintaining pipelines in Microsoft Fabric. A common misconception is that data reliability is solely ensured by using high-quality data sources. While data source quality is important, actual reliability hinges on the entire pipeline's design and management. Over-relying on input quality can lead to significant operational pitfalls. For instance, if your pipeline lacks robust error handling, even the highest-quality data may become inconsistent or corrupted during processing. This can lead to poor decision-making and loss of trust in your data.

Another risk lies in assumptions about real-time data. Teams may believe that having live data equates to reliability, but without proper validation and checks, real-time outputs can be misleading. Regular monitoring and automated testing can help mitigate these issues, yet many teams overlook these practices.

Modern AI tools can support data reliability efforts through enhanced error detection or anomaly identification, but they also pose risks if they introduce complexities without proper understanding. Reliance on AI alone can exacerbate existing issues, as it may not fully grasp domain-specific contexts. Prioritizing clarity and sound practices in pipeline design remains vital for ensuring lasting data reliability.
