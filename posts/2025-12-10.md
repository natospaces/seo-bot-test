### Addressing Excel Reliability Risks in Business Reporting for Data Engineers

Excel is a common tool in business reporting, but its reliability poses significant risks for data engineering teams. When engineers work alongside non-technical leaders, inconsistencies in data handling often arise. Leaders might insist on using Excel for reporting without fully understanding its limitations. This reliance can lead to errors in data entry, formula miscalculations, or version control problems, which directly impact decision-making.

Engineers may overlook the implications of these errors due to a false sense of security surrounding Excel's familiarity. For example, changes made by non-technical users might inadvertently alter critical data without the engineers’ notification. Consequently, reports generated from inaccurate data could drive misguided business strategies, resulting in lost revenue and diminished trust in data insights.

Furthermore, data silos can emerge when teams rely on localized Excel files, making it challenging for engineers to maintain an integrated data pipeline. This fragmentation leads to inconsistent reporting and complicates oversight.

While modern AI tools can streamline reporting processes, they can also exacerbate reliance on flawed Excel practices if not implemented with due diligence. Clear communication and collaboration between engineers and leadership are essential to mitigate these risks and ensure reliable reporting practices.
