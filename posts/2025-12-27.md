### Hidden Risks of Poor Data Quality in Production Datasets 

Data quality failures can significantly harm a company’s operational efficiency and decision-making processes. When engineers and non-technical leaders work together, miscommunication often leads to conflicting interpretations of datasets. For example, if engineers prioritize technical accuracy without explaining their metrics’ implications, non-technical leaders may base strategic decisions on flawed information. This misalignment results in wasted resources and missed opportunities.

Another critical risk arises from dependence on outdated or unreliable vendor data. Teams often assume data from third-party sources is high quality, but vendors may not prioritize data integrity. Leaders who rely on this data without validation face operational issues that ripple through the organization. Decisions made on erroneous reports can misguide investors and customers, eroding trust and damaging reputations.

Moreover, modern AI tools can exacerbate data quality issues by automating poor processes instead of improving them. If teams fail to establish strong data governance protocols, AI solutions may amplify errors rather than correct them. Therefore, fostering collaboration between engineers and leaders is essential to ensure comprehensive data quality checks. This focus can aid leaders in using AI responsibly while mitigating risks associated with poor data quality.
